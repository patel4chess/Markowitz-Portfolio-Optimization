# The Efficient Frontier (Markowitz Portfolio Optimisation)

By definition, Index Fund is a type of mutual fund with a portfolio to match or construct the
components of a market index.

Inspired by value investors such as Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham we tried to find whether
the stocks are over/under valued.

For the project, we analyzed 15 sectors and 150 companies which were narrowed down to 15
fundamentally strong companies in which we are going to invest (for now virtually).

The narrowing down part is what makes our project one of its kind. Usually the indices are
based on market capitalization (net worth) of the company, but what we did was analyses each
and every company based on its financial ratios, income statements like profit-loss statement
and balance sheet and finally the Management discussion and analysis report of the company.
Our aim was to learn and familiarize ourselves with what we call the fundamental analysis of a
company.

Fundamental analysis of any company majorly comprises of quantitative analysis and qualitative
analysis.
